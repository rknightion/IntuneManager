## Configuration

### MSAL Setup
1. Register your app in Azure AD
2. Get your Client ID and Tenant ID
3. Update `MSALConfiguration.swift` with your values
4. Or use the in-app configuration screen on first launch

### Bundle Identifier
Make sure your bundle identifier matches what's registered in Azure AD for the redirect URI:
- Redirect URI format: `msauth.{your-bundle-id}://auth`

## Building & Running

### iOS
1. Select an iOS Simulator or device
2. Press âŒ˜R to build and run

### macOS
1. Select "My Mac" as the destination
2. Press âŒ˜R to build and run

## Troubleshooting

### "No such module 'MSAL'"
- Make sure you've added the package dependencies (see step 1 above)
- Clean build folder: âŒ˜â‡§K
- Reset package caches: File â†’ Packages â†’ Reset Package Caches

### App doesn't launch
- Check that Info.plist path is correctly set
- Verify entitlements file path is set
- Check Console.app for crash logs

### MSAL Authentication fails
- Verify your redirect URI matches: `msauth.{bundle-id}://auth`
- Check keychain sharing is enabled
- Ensure Client ID and Tenant ID are correct
