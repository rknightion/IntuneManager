## Why use IntuneManager?

- **Unified dashboard:** A single view of enrolment, compliance, application health, and assignment coverage with keyboard-accessible charts and filters.
- **Fast device triage:** Filter by OS, ownership, compliance, encryption, and supervision to locate the device you need in seconds, then trigger a sync or drill into details.
- **Bulk application assignments:** Select multiple apps, choose target groups, preview existing assignments, and post Graph API requests in one flow.
- **Configuration profile insight:** Browse catalog, templates, and assignments with split-view navigation optimised for macOS.
- **Actionable reporting:** Review deployment stats, top deployed apps, and recent Intune audit logs with live filters.

## Supported Platforms

IntuneManager is built with SwiftUI and ships as a macOS app.

| Platform | Availability | Highlights |
